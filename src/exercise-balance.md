## Account balance query exercise
Create an application exercise-balance.js which queries the account balance of the addresses inputAddress, outputAddress and remainderAddress to which you used in the sens.js file.

Use `iota.getBalances(addresses, 100)`.
Where addresses is a list of addresses, a balance object returns a list of balances and associated milestones.
